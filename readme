The PlainJS program can be run from the browser by running the live server on the index.html for the PlainJS folder. 
The ReactJS program can be run from any terminal using npm. 
    Simply
        'cd react-task-manager' once you're in the reactJS folder. 
        'npm start' 
        If it doesn't automatically pop up, go to localhost:300

Within the PlainJS folder, all functions and features are running great. 
    - A name can be added and deleted.
Within the ReactJS folder, when run, once a friend is added, a name does not pop up. 
    - I used the features (components) to implement other parts of the Friends Facebook Manager such as separating the header, the input, and friends list. 
    - This is something you can't do in plain JS and is an added feature in ReactJS.
